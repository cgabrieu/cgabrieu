ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Carlos - a full-stack & iOS developer with 3+ years of experience. I work with Node.js, React, SwiftUI and AWS (AppSync, Lambda, DynamoDB, etc.), building apps end to end.

ðŸ’¡ I'm all about writing clean, readable code thatâ€™s easy to maintain. I follow Clean Code principles, cover features with automated tests and keep performance and simplicity in mind.

ðŸ‘¥ Iâ€™ve worked in agile teams (Scrum mostly), enjoy pair programming and value clear communication as much as clean code.

ðŸš€ I'm always learning something new - whether it's a framework, a smarter way to debug or better ways to ship features faster.
